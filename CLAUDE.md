# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Cloner project.

## Project Overview

Cloner is a full-stack application template created with the `newpeer` command. It provides a foundation for rapid development with modern tools and deployment-ready configuration.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python 3.11+
- **Database**: SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL ready (prod)  
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Server**: Uvicorn on port 8000
- **Deployment**: Render

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Dev Server**: Port 5173
- **Styling**: CSS with custom green theme
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## Development Commands

### Quick Start
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && python main.py

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Backend Commands
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py               # Start server
```

### Frontend Commands  
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                  # Start dev server
npm run build               # Build for production
npm run lint                # Run linting
```

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy models, API routes, CORS configuration
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite, custom green color theme
- **Deployment**: render.yaml for backend, netlify.toml for frontend
- **MCP**: Configured with Playwright, Desktop Automation, Plasmo servers

## Key Features

- ✅ **Full-stack template** ready for development
- ✅ **CORS configured** for local development and production
- ✅ **Database ready** with SQLAlchemy models
- ✅ **Deployment ready** for Render + Netlify
- ✅ **MCP integrated** with browser and desktop automation

- ✅ **Health checks** and API documentation

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Backend: `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` 
- Database: SQLite file

### Production
- Backend: Render deployment with environment detection
- Frontend: Netlify with build optimization
- Database: SQLite (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL)

## Deployment

- **Render**: Automatic deployment via render.yaml
- **Netlify**: Automatic deployment via netlify.toml
- **Environment Variables**: Configured for production CORS

## MCP Servers

This project is configured with:
- **Playwright**: Browser automation (`npx @playwright/mcp@latest`)
- **Desktop Automation**: Desktop interaction tools  
- **Plasmo MCP Server**: Extension development capabilities

Use these for testing, automation, and enhanced development workflows.
